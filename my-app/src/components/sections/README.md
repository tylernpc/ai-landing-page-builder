# Section components

Composable UI sections built from shadcn primitives.

- hero.tsx: renders the hero section (title, subtitle, optional image).
- features-grid.tsx: three-column feature cards.
- pricing.tsx: tiered pricing cards with CTA.

These accept typed props from `src/types/landing.ts`. Keep presentational and stateless here.
